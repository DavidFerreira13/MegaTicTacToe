# MegaTicTacToe

This game is played on a 3 by 3 square grid.
You are X, your friend (and also the computer in Single Player) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
The first player to make a line of 3 of her marks (vertically, horizontally or diagonally) is the winner.
If all 9 squares are full with no line of 3, the game is tied.
You place a mark by typing the coordinates, as shown in the grid.
